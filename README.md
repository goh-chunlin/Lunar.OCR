This is a project for demonstrating how Tesseract and Azure Computer Vision can be used in an UWP app to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR). 
The app now supports three languages, i.e. English, Simplified Chinese, and Korean.

Currently, the UWP app with Tesseract cannot be published on the Microsoft Store. Hence, the app on Microsoft Store will only perform OCR with
Azure Computer Vision. If you would like to build an UWP app with Tesseract and run it locally, please checkout the code from the master branch.
