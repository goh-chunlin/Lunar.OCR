## Lunar OCR

This is a project for demonstrating how Tesseract and Azure Computer Vision can be used in an UWP app to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The app now supports three languages, i.e. English, Simplified Chinese, and Korean.

Currently, the UWP app available on Microsoft Store works fine with only Azure Computer Vision on Windows 10 PC and on Hololens 2 (Emulator). Hence, if you would like to try out Tesseract, please download the source code directly from the GitHub and then deploy the UWP app locally.
